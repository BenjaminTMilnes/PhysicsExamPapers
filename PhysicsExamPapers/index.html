        <h1>Physics Exam Papers</h1>
        <p>This web app can be used to generate practice exam papers on various fields within physics, where the questions of the exam paper contain randomly generated numbers and values. This means that you can have an effectively infinite supply of practice material.</p>
        <p>Click on a topic from the list below to start a practice paper.</p>
        <h2>Topics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="application.html?exam=general_relativity">General Relativity</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How is the exam paper marked?</h2>
        <p>Rather than give you a percentage of the number of questions that you got correct, or the number of marks you got, the web app gives you a level at the end of an exam. That level represents your ability in that field of physics. The highest level is 100; however, not all of the exams have level 100 questions in them, and so the highest possible level for any one exam is often a lot lower.</p>
