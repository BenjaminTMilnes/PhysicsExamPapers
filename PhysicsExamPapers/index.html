    <h1>Physics Exam Papers</h1>
    <p>This web app can be used to generate practice exam papers on various fields within physics, where the questions of the exam paper contain randomly generated numbers and values. This means that you can have an effectively infinite supply of practice material - which is essential for learning physics.</p>
    <h2>How is the exam paper marked?</h2>
    <p>Rather than give you a percentage of the number of questions that you got correct, or the number of marks you got, the web app gives you a level at the end of an exam. That level represents your ability in that field of physics. The highest level is 100; however, not all of the exams have level 100 questions in them, and so the highest possible level for any one exam is often a lot lower.</p>
    <h2>"It's really easy to cheat."</h2>
    <p>Yes. Yes it is. It is very easy to cheat on these exam papers and get all of the answers right - just look in the Network tab of your browser console and you'll see the answers sent down to your machine with the questions. You could cheat very easily, but that's not the point of this web app. This web app is a learning and revision tool.</p>
